ABSTRACT
Rajasthan is one of the most admired tourist destinations in India, 
which attracts various tourists across the globe for its ancient forts, art and culture.
Every other foreign tourist visiting India also travels to Rajasthan as it is a part of the Golden Triangle for various tourists visiting India. Despite our rich cultural heritage, the tourists visiting these places are unaware of the great historical events that took place during the medieval period. 
This often happens due to lack of information by our own people working as tourist guides as they are unable to clearly describe the actual facts and figures to those ambitious tourists (guests) who are eager to observe our exquisite carving work that has survived till date and still receives appreciation from people worldwide.
So we are developing a smart guiding automated system for tourists (Smart-GAT). 
This would help tourists to understand the exact information of each and every section of that location via headphones when they tend to come closer to the place and even written text regarding the complete history of that location shall be provided. This would greatly solve the problem of ignominious guides and the visitors would be self-entertained by our system. They could easily enjoy the beauty of the place along with the correct information being provided by our system.
