SMART-GAT(Smart Guiding Automated System For Tourists)

⦁	What was the problem?
  (Q1)ANSWER:
Our product deals with problem of untutored tourist guides around the globe. Whenever an individual such as a tourist reaches a particular location such as a tourist spot, he/she faces the problems of lack of guidance as well as lack of information. Let us take a real time example:-
⦁	When a individual (say foreign tourists or researchers) comes to visit a monument or say a historic place, and the person does not know anything about the place, In order to obtain the historical and cultural significance of that place, the individual has to hire a guide that would help him to know about the classical important of that place and thus make the experience smooth. The person has to pay a handsome amount to the guide without even obtaining the correct (genuine) information from the trickster guide. Most of the tourists are eager and curious in acquiring the vast cultural and historical knowledge about India, but they are completely made fooled by the guides being hired by them, which not only leaves a bad impression about the people of our country but also foreigners are no longer interested in visiting our country again. Since most of the guides are clever in fooling the foreign tourists by making up their own stories thereby leaving an inadequate impression and overall the information provided by these guides might not be authentic. In order to overcome this problem our product (S. guide) comes in.
⦁	Now take an entirely different case in which say an individual gets information that his known has suffered an accident and has been admitted in the hospital, when the individual reaches the hospital he/she has to search for his admitted companion across the building asking people to guide him to the patient’s room, here is where (s-guide) comes into play. It would not only reduce the struggle but also help him thereby saving his/her time.

⦁	How did you solve it (Inventive Step)?
(Q2)ANSWER:
 Smart guide (S.guide) would be a saviour to wastage of time and piloting beyond open source maps. Smart guide would have various functions and each one of it would make human life easy. Smart guide would help tourists to know about various tourist places by giving them the required detailed information regarding the place via text and audio format. S.guide would help the people to reach their destination indoors easily and efficiently. It would save time and would be fruitful in various cases (crunch situations). It is a piece of hardware integrated with tech, making exploration much easier. For an instance, a foreign researcher visits Taj Mahal, and the person wants to research on various scriptures and historical artefact being located in Taj Mahal. So in order to avoid hiring unauthorised guides, the person can use our S.guide system which would be helpful in a very effective way thereby saving his/her precious time. 

. What were the other possible solutions and why they could not be done?
(Q3)ANSWER:
Most of the foreign tourists visiting these ancient monuments are eager to know the detailed history of that place and no such offline system has been made so far, that can provide relevant information to the user in offline mode.
The other solutions could be indoor offline as well as online Google maps which can be helpful in guiding the tourists through various places inside the monuments but it requires an active online connection and since most of the forts and monuments are located in the arid areas where a strong net connection cannot be established, the Google maps won’t work. Despite this, the indoor maps are not available for most of the places and also various authorities does not permit indoor maps of their areas due to security reasons and several other policy issues.

⦁	What are the advantages of the solution proposed by you?
(Q4)ANSWER:
The advantages of the solution proposed by us is as follows :-
1: The problem of tourist guidance and expensive hiring of guides at tourist spots would be easily tackled.
2: It would make the experience of foreign tourists much easier and more enjoyable thereby attracting more foreigners in our country.
4: It would expand the access of individuals to various spots smoother and fruitfully.
5: It would make tourism to reach a new era where the complete information regarding the history, geography, architecture and overall knowledge related to that spot would be given to the tourist thereby enhancing and improving the overall experience to visit these places.
6: The user experience with the product would be smooth due to interactive interface and it can also be used by a laymen person, and also our system would comprise of different languages as per the user’s choice. 
7: The user experience would not be limited to the hardware as we are developing an app for Smartphone to serve the same purpose.
8. The person visiting the monuments can also give their feedback which would help the managing authorities of that place to make necessary changes according to the Tourists comfort and needs.

⦁	Explain the stepwise working of the innovation explaining all the components used in the invention and the specific function they are performing.
(Q5)Answer:
At present, QR codes are found everywhere and they have been used for various purposes.  We are using QR codes in a different way to serve our purpose. 
The stepwise working of our invention is as follow:-
1: Our device is a hardware component which works on raspberry pi. The raspberry pi drives the hardware to serve the purpose that is to provide brief information to the people visiting various forts and other tourist places. When the person enters the fort, he/she would be provided with the S.guide system and the person would plug-in the ear plugs and would simply use the system according to his own needs.
2. The system would make the person familiar with the surroundings and would also guide him to different places. Whenever the person would come across any interesting painting or scripture, he can simply scan the QR code being located near the wall and whole of the information would be displayed on the user’s system that can be easily read in the form of text and will be audible through the earphones being attached to our system. 
Internal Working of System:
As soon as the user scans the QR code through the S.guide, a URL would be generated and the user has to click on the URL which would redirect him to a webpage and all the information will be loaded on the user’s LCD touch screen. As our system works in offline mode, the displayed information will run on local host so that no internet is required. 
Our system would also comprise a user’s feedback forum which would be stored into our system so that the person can share their experiences with us and can also give suggestions for necessary changes in our system for the betterment of that place. 
3: The hardware which we are making consists of the following components:-
⦁	Raspberry pi                                                                          
⦁	LCD touch screen                                                             
⦁	Audio amplifier
⦁	Wires
⦁	Pi-camera
⦁	Power supply
4: Our scanning system would scan the QR code with the help of the pi-camera which is used to obtain information being stored within the QR code.

5: We are building our system for both online as well as offline mode that could be helpful for the places like hospitals, schools, colleges, industries, companies, large offices, shopping malls, shops etc. The hardware could also work in places like shops and malls as the consumer could easily read the prices and can also compare the prices online along with other necessary details for that particular commodity.
